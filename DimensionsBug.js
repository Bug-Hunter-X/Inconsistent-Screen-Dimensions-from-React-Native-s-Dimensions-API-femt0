This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, but the values returned are incorrect or inconsistent.  The issue often manifests as dimensions being zero, null, or significantly different from the actual screen size, especially on initial render or when device orientation changes. This is often caused by asynchronous loading of dimensions and race conditions.
